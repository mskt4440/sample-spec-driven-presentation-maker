# Style — a reusable style guide

## Role

You turn the user's visual preferences (verbal direction, brand material, an existing PPTX)
into a reusable style guide that later decks apply with `apply_style`. Work in the user's
language for the dialogue; write the style document itself in English unless the user asks
otherwise — composers read it as instructions.

## What a style is

A style is one HTML file that does three jobs at once: it is the **rulebook** the composer
reads before building slides, the **reference** the next style author imitates, and the
**sample** a person browses in the gallery. Colour swatches and a type ramp alone are not a
style — what makes decks look consistent and deliberate is the part that says *how this style
builds a slide*: how titles are phrased, how much goes on one slide, how a comparison or a
process or a table is laid out here rather than anywhere else.

`start_style(base)` — the call that gave you this document — also returned the style
catalogue (`styles`) and one bundled style's HTML (`base`) to imitate; `run_style_python` with
`read_style(name)` reads any other. Every bundled style follows the skeleton below; keep it.

## Skeleton

A style is **the first deck built in that style, about that style**. Every slide is a real
slide of the style — its frame, its components, its density — and says something the composer
needs: the rules, the message grammar, how a comparison or a table is built here. Nothing is a
specimen sheet: the palette is seen on the slides and explained in `:root`, the type ramp is
the slides' own titles and body, components are defined where a slide first uses them.

This is also what makes the gallery honest: a person choosing a style sees slides that look
exactly like the deck they will get. A style whose own slides break its own rules is a false
sample — denser than its density, or wearing decoration its rules never define — and so is one
whose slides are plainer than the decks it promises: composers copy what they see, so a look
the style wants must appear on its own slides.

Parts, in this order, each opened by a marker comment (`<!-- Part: Rules -->`):

| Part | Content |
|---|---|
| `<head>` | `<title>` is `name — one paragraph`: audience, purpose, the design decision, the signature look; it becomes the description in `list_styles()`. `:root` holds the tokens (contract below), each with a short comment saying its job (which colour means what, when a size is used, max lines). CSS follows. |
| Cover | The style's cover. **Always the first `.slide`** — the gallery thumbnail. |
| Rules | The design decision (who reads this, in what setting, under what constraint) and the DO / DON'T that **follow from it**. As many slides as the rules need at the style's own density. |
| Message & Outline | What the orchestrator reads before writing the outline: title grammar, one claim per slide, per-slide density, lead-in and closing conventions, chapter shape (agenda tracker, section dividers, summary first…), favoured visual forms. **Deck length is not the style's decision**: it follows the brief and material. |
| Patterns | One slide per recurring slide type, each built as that pattern and explaining it: the comparison slide compares, the process slide is a process of how to build one. Required: `comparison`, `columns`, `process`, `metric`, `table`, `chart`, `diagram` (a relationship drawn as a form — cycle, hub, hierarchy or matrix — with the style's icons, nodes and connectors; it shows how much this style illustrates); add what the style is for (`relationship`, `before-after`, `text`, `media`, `timeline`, `matrix`, `dashboard`, `swimlane`, `code`, `architecture`). Open with a section divider. |
| Closing | The closing frame, ending on what makes the style this style. |

**Frames** are the elements repeated on every slide — title band, section label, agenda
tracker — plus the section divider and the closing slide. They appear on every slide of the
file; comment them once, at first use: `<!-- Frame: content — … -->`, `<!-- Frame: divider — … -->`,
`<!-- Frame: closing — … -->`.

**Patterns** carry one comment each, which is what the layout pass reads:
`<!-- Pattern: comparison — for: …; regions: left, right, takeaway; components: container ×2 + selected + takeaway; may vary: …; may not: … -->`.
Region names are the ones the layout pass writes (`body`, `left` / `right`, `col-1`…,
`step-1`…, `media`, `chart`, `table`, `takeaway`, `kpi-1`…).

**Density.** Every visible slide obeys the style's own density rule, which the Message & Outline
part states in words and once as a marker the contract test reads: `<!-- Density: 45 -->`
(maximum visible words on any slide of the file, labels included). When the rules or the grammar need more words than one slide allows, use more
slides — never smaller type or tighter boxes. Detail a person does not need in order to judge
the style — the reason behind each rule, exact coordinates, edge cases — goes in the HTML
comment next to the slide. Say each thing once: the comment adds to the visible text, it does
not repeat it.

**One fact in one place.** Token values live in `:root`, a frame is commented where it first
appears, a component where it is first used, a pattern on its own slide. Leave out what is
neither an instruction nor a sample: invented sources, captions that repeat the comment,
notes explaining the demo.

## Component vocabulary

Roles are shared by every style; how a role looks is each style's decision. Naming components
by role lets a composer find "this style's selected card" in any style, and lets patterns and
the layout pass name what fills a region the same way everywhere. Define each component with a
comment directly before the slide element that first uses it:
`<!-- Component: <role> (.<class>) — when; may vary: …; may not: … -->`. A required role the
style does without still gets its line — `<!-- Component: container — none; group by
whitespace and rules -->` — so a composer never guesses.

| Group | Roles | Required |
|---|---|---|
| Grouping | `container` (card, panel, or what replaces it), `selected` (the one emphasised member) | both |
| Text | `takeaway` (the one-line conclusion), `numbered` (numbered point or finding), `list`, `lead`, `quote` | `takeaway`, `numbered` |
| Numbers | `metric` (figure + unit + comparator), `delta`, `before-after`, `progress` | `metric` |
| Sequence | `step` + `connector`, `phase` (stage header), `milestone` | `step` + `connector` |
| Relationship | `hub` (centre and satellites), `hierarchy`, `axis` (2×2 or spectrum), `brace` (items gathered into one conclusion) | — |
| Labels | `tag` (status or category), `marker` (number or point marker), `legend` | `tag` |
| Evidence | `table`, `chart` (native; the comment carries series colours, highlight, labels, baseline), `media` (image or screenshot treatment), `code`, `icon` (size, colour, what it sits on, which family) | `table`, `chart`, `icon` |

Decoration comes from the style's design decision and has a job there. Define it like any
component, and say in its comment what it is for; a decoration without a job does not belong in
the style.

Define the optional roles the style is for and leave the rest out. Every style draws diagrams —
the slide JSON spec's Visual forms are available to every deck — so what a style decides is how
they look here: the node, the connector, the icon, the marker.

**Shape classes.** When a component uses a shape other than a rectangle, give it a class named
after the slide JSON `shape` value — `.shape-<name>`, with `_` written as `-` — so class → JSON
is mechanical. Draw it with `clip-path` or borders on the `.el` box; the inline style still
carries only the box. Copy just the ones the style uses:

```css
/* JSON "pentagon" is the arrow-tipped phase header (home plate), not a regular pentagon */
.shape-pentagon { --notch: 40px; clip-path: polygon(0 0, calc(100% - var(--notch)) 0, 100% 50%, calc(100% - var(--notch)) 100%, 0 100%); }
.shape-chevron  { --notch: 40px; clip-path: polygon(0 0, calc(100% - var(--notch)) 0, 100% 50%, calc(100% - var(--notch)) 100%, 0 100%, var(--notch) 50%); padding-left: var(--notch); }
.shape-triangle { clip-path: polygon(50% 0, 100% 100%, 0 100%); }
.shape-diamond  { clip-path: polygon(50% 0, 100% 50%, 50% 100%, 0 50%); }
.shape-hexagon  { clip-path: polygon(25% 0, 75% 0, 100% 50%, 75% 100%, 25% 100%, 0 50%); }
.shape-oval     { border-radius: 50%; }
.shape-donut    { border-radius: 50%; background: none; border: 24px solid var(--accent); }
.shape-block-arc { --sweep: 73%; --ring: 24px; border-radius: 50%;
  background: conic-gradient(var(--accent) var(--sweep), var(--color-surface) 0);
  mask: radial-gradient(farthest-side, transparent calc(100% - var(--ring)), #000 calc(100% - var(--ring))); }
```

Keep the notch in px: PowerPoint sizes the point from the shorter side — in the JSON it is
`adjustments: [notch ÷ shorter side]` (default 0.5) — so a `%` notch that grows with the width
misleads. Consecutive chevrons nest by overlapping the notch minus the gap you want
(`x` of the next = `x + width − notch + gap`); state notch and gap in the component comment. Vary the notch with a
modifier class (`.notch-sm { --notch: 24px; }`), never inline.

## Token contract

The `:root` block is machine-read; the rest is read by agents and people.

- Exactly one `:root { … }` block. `apply_style` parses it with a regular expression.
- `--color-text` is required: `apply_style` copies it into `deck.json` as `defaultTextColor`.
  `--color-bg` is the ground: `apply_style` copies it as `defaultBackground`, and every slide
  that does not set its own `background` is filled with it, so a cream or near-black style
  keeps its ground on any template. Also define `--color-surface`, `--color-border`,
  `--color-muted`, and the accents (`--accent`, `--accent-2`, …, and `--success` / `--danger`
  only if the style uses them).
- Font sizes are `--fs-<role>: NNpt;` — e.g. `--fs-cover-title`, `--fs-slide-title`,
  `--fs-heading`, `--fs-body`, `--fs-caption`, `--fs-label`, `--fs-metric`. The build-time
  font-size lint accepts exactly these values, so every size a composer may use must be a
  token. Any other prefix is invisible to the lint.
- `--font-family` (and `--font-mono` if used) is for the HTML rendering only. Use fonts that
  are installed on ordinary machines (Georgia, Arial, Helvetica Neue, Segoe UI, Consolas,
  Menlo, with a Japanese fallback such as Hiragino Sans, Yu Gothic, Meiryo, Noto Sans JP);
  never web-only fonts. The PPTX fonts come from the template, not the style.
- Geometry tokens (`--margin-x`, `--content-w`, `--content-top`, `--bar-h`, `--radius`,
  `--border-thin`, `--shadow`) make the grid explicit so composers derive coordinates from
  one source.

## HTML constraints

The demo slides are read as coordinates, so the format is constrained:

- Slides are `<div class="slide …">` at the top level of `<body>`, never nested, 1920×1080 with
  `body { zoom: 0.7 }`.
- Every element is an absolutely positioned `.el` whose inline `style` carries only
  `left/top/width/height` (and nothing else). Colours, fonts and sizes resolve through `:root`
  variables or shared classes, so a composer can map class → token → JSON.
- No layout that hides coordinates: no flexbox or CSS grid *between* `.el`s. Inside a single
  `.el`, `display:flex` for aligning its own children (a number beside a label) is acceptable
  because the `.el` box itself is still explicit.
- Font sizes in `pt`, never `px` or `em`. **Render them at slide scale:** the 1920 px canvas is
  960 slide-pt wide (1 slide-pt = 2 px), but CSS draws 1pt as 1.333 px, so raw `font-size:
  var(--fs-body)` shows type at two thirds of its real size and every box copied from the demo
  is too small. Every text class therefore multiplies: `font-size: calc(var(--fs-body) * 1.5)`.
  The token stays `NNpt` (the lint reads it); only the rendering is scaled. Box heights in the
  demo then match what the composer will measure: one line ≈ `fs × 2 × 1.2` px. (1.5 is the
  factor for the 16:9 canvas, 960 slide-pt across 1920 px; a 4:3 template is 720 slide-pt wide,
  so its text comes out relatively larger — the demos are 16:9.)
- Frame geometry must fit the largest allowed text: the title box holds two lines at
  `--fs-slide-title` (40pt → 192 px), and `--content-top` sits below it. One-line titles leave
  the second line empty; content never moves up to fill it.
- No emoji anywhere — the PPTX renderer has no emoji fonts. Icons come from `search_assets`.
- Icons are inline SVG, because the gallery renders the file on its own (relative asset paths do
  not resolve there). One line directly after `<body>` holds the symbols the file uses —
  `<svg width="0" height="0" style="position:absolute" aria-hidden="true"><symbol id="material/hub" viewBox="0 -960 960 960"><path d="…"/></symbol>…</svg>` —
  with each `id` the `search_assets` name, `<source>/<name>`, and the path copied from that
  asset, so the JSON `src` is `assets:` + the id. Draw one with
  `<svg class="icon"><use href="#material/hub"/></svg>`; its colour is `fill` from a token (the
  JSON `iconColor`). Multi-colour service icons (`aws/…`) keep their own colours.

## Writing the rules

- **Prohibit only what the decision rules out.** A DON'T needs a reason in this style's
  decision, never a general taste for restraint; a ban the decision does not require is not a
  rule — leave it out.
- **State the design decision, then derive the rules.** "This deck is read alone by someone
  deciding; the title row alone must carry the argument" leads to "titles are full-sentence
  assertions, ≤ 2 lines, the largest text on the slide" and "no topic-label titles". A DON'T
  without a reason is a rule the composer will bend.
- **Rules that hold for every style, state them anyway** so the style is self-contained: one
  claim per slide; the title is the claim; every colour has a job the style names; text contrast ≥ 4.5:1 (3:1 for ≥ 18pt); charts label
  values directly and drop gridlines that carry no information; margins ≥ 5% of the slide
  edge; no emoji; structure is drawn, not written — steps, loops, parts, a centre and its
  satellites, trade-offs and quantities become forms, and text is kept for claims that are
  sentences.
- **Say how much the style illustrates.** One rule states where icons appear (card heads,
  nodes, icon + label rows — or none, with shapes and numerals carrying the concepts, when the
  design decision demands it), their size, colour and family, and which forms the style favours
  and how dense a diagram may get. The `diagram` pattern is that rule's sample.
- **Describe by design, not by brand.** Do not name companies, firms or presenters whose
  decks the style resembles, and do not describe the style as "what AI decks look like" or
  its opposite. Say what the style does and for whom.
- **State rules, not engine behaviour.** "This style has no shadows" is a rule; "shapes render
  without a shadow unless `shadow` is set" is how the builder works and does not belong in a
  style. If a default behaviour of the engine surprises composers, fix the engine rather than
  warn about it in every style. The only renderer facts worth stating are limits a composer
  cannot infer (native tables inherit the template font; slide JSON has no letter-spacing,
  line-height or intermediate font weights).
- **Comment frames, components and patterns** where they first appear: what it is for, why it is
  built this way in this style, what to vary and what not to.
- **The slides talk about the style**, never about a real deck's subject. A chart or table
  pattern needs numbers: use a few plainly illustrative values.

## Working procedure

- If the request starts with `[Style: <name>]`, that is the file name to save under; otherwise
  derive a short kebab-case name.
- Save with `write_style(name, html)` in `run_style_python`; it stores the file in the user's
  style store (locally `~/.config/sdpm/styles/`), where `list_styles()` and the gallery pick it
  up. Each write is immediately visible, so write incrementally — `:root` and the cover first,
  then parts in order — and refine.
- `analyze_template(...)` reads a reference PPTX's theme; `read_guides(["import-pptx"])` when
  the reference deck should be inspected slide by slide.
- Token choices must survive conversion to PPTX: when the environment offers it, apply the
  style to a sample deck, build and preview before finishing.
