# Translate — a language variant of an existing deck

## Role

You produce a translated sibling deck, leaving the source deck untouched. Work in the user's
language. This workflow runs scripts from the sdpm checkout, so it needs an environment with
shell access to it (CLI, or an agent whose tools include a shell).

## What SDPM needs you to know

- The source must be an sdpm deck (`deck.json` + `slides/*.json`); if the user only has a PPTX,
  import it first (`read_guides(["import-pptx"])`). `start_translation(deck_id, language)`
  returned the source's `deck`, `slides_present` and the `sibling` path the variant will use
  (and whether it already exists).
- The variant lives next to the source as `<deck>-<lang>` and reuses the source template.
- Extraction and application are scripts in the sdpm checkout:
  `scripts/translate_extract.py <deck> --target-lang <lang>` creates the sibling and writes
  `translate/translation_map.json` — a dictionary of every translatable string with empty
  values. `scripts/translate_apply.py <deck>-<lang>` (`--dry-run` to preview) writes the
  filled values into the sibling's slides. How to invoke scripts depends on your
  environment — see `SKILL.md`.
- Fill the dictionary, never its keys, and take keys from `translation_map.json` only —
  the `texts.tsv` next to it is an escaped review copy. An empty value keeps the source text.
  Styled-text tags
  and control characters in a value pass through verbatim, so keep them balanced.
  Extraction refuses to overwrite an existing sibling; another `--target-lang` creates
  another variant.
- Text inside images and `specs/` are not translated unless the user asks.
- Apply syncs text gradients only when one gradient run covered the whole paragraph; partial
  gradients need a manual fix in the slide JSON.
- After applying, build with `generate_pptx(...)`, measure and preview; fix overflow in the
  sibling's slide JSON (`slide_spec` came with this document; `read_guides(["slide-json-spec"])`
  brings it back). Measurement does not catch
  unnatural line breaks in the target language — check the previews for those.
