"""Centralized resource access control for spec-driven-presentation-maker.

Security: AWS manages infrastructure security. You manage access control,
data classification, and IAM policies. See SECURITY.md for details.

Used by both api/ and servers/remote/ for Deck-level authorization.

Role resolution order:
  1. USER#{user_id} + DECK#{deck_id} exists → owner
  2. SHARED#{user_id} + DECK#{deck_id} exists → collaborator
  3. Deck visibility=public → viewer
  4. None of the above → none (access denied)

Permission matrix: action × role determines allowed/denied.

Customization:
  - To add roles: modify resolve_role() to check additional DDB records.
  - To add actions: add entries to DEFAULT_PERMISSIONS.
  - This is the single file to modify for authorization changes.
