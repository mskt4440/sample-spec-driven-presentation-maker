# Custom Templates, Styles, and Assets

spec-driven-presentation-maker works with any `.pptx` file as a template.
It automatically analyzes the template's layouts, colors, fonts, and placeholders — no manual configuration needed.

Beyond templates, three other resource types can be customized per-user:

- **Templates** (`.pptx`) — slide masters
- **Styles** (`.html`) — design guides used by the agent
- **Assets** (images such as `.svg`, `.png`) — icons, logos, illustrations
- **Config** (`config.json`) — output directory, extra asset sources, etc.

All four support user-local placement so your customizations survive
`pip install --upgrade` or a repository re-clone.

## How Template Analysis Works

When you call `analyze_template`, the engine inspects the .pptx file and extracts:

- **Slide layouts** — Name, dimensions, placeholder positions and sizes
- **Theme colors** — Background, accent colors, text colors
- **Fonts** — Heading and body fonts
- **Placeholders** — Title, body, footer with exact coordinates

The agent uses this information to place elements precisely within the template's design system.

---

## Creating a Template

Design your template in PowerPoint, Google Slides, or Keynote (export as .pptx):

1. **Define slide layouts** — At minimum, create:
   - A title slide layout
   - A content slide layout (title placeholder + body area)
   - A section divider layout (optional)
   - A blank layout (for custom designs)

2. **Set theme colors** — Define your brand colors in the slide master's color theme. The agent reads these and uses them consistently.

3. **Set fonts** — Define heading and body fonts in the slide master. The agent extracts these automatically.

4. **Keep it clean** — Remove sample content from layouts. The agent works with placeholder positions, not sample text.

5. **Add layout instructions via speaker notes** — Write usage instructions in the speaker notes of each layout's sample slide. The agent reads these when analyzing the template and follows them when building slides with that layout.

   Examples:
   - "Use this layout for two-column comparisons"
   - "Place images on the right side only"
   - "Title should be kept to one line"

### Tips

- Use descriptive layout names (e.g., "Content with Image", "Two Column") — the agent reads these names
- Ensure background-to-text color contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1
- Test your template by running `analyze_template` and reviewing the output

### Slide size (aspect ratio)

Any slide size works — 16:9, 4:3, 16:10, and other ratios are all supported.
The engine derives the drawing canvas from your template's actual dimensions.

The coordinate system is **1920 px wide, with height following the aspect ratio**:

| Template slide size | Canvas in slide JSON |
|---|---|
| 16:9 (13.33 × 7.5 in) | 1920 × 1080 px |
| 4:3 (10 × 7.5 in) | 1920 × 1440 px |
| 16:10 | 1920 × 1200 px |

`analyze_template` reports the canvas size as `slide_size`, and the agent records
it in `deck.json` as `slideSize` so that slide composition uses the full canvas.

Known limitations for non-16:9 templates:

- **Architecture diagram boxes** — fixed in #285. Box auto-height is now
  calibrated using `slideSize.ptPerPx` (the pt-to-px conversion rate reported
  by `analyze_template` and stored in `deck.json`). Explicit `box.height` is
  still accepted for manual fine-tuning.
- **Style demos** — the bundled style gallery HTML files use a fixed 16:9 canvas.
  This does not affect generated slides (only the design tokens are consumed).
- **Deck list thumbnails** — the Web UI deck list crops thumbnails to a fixed
  ratio so that card heights stay aligned in the grid. Slide previews
  (workspace, carousel) follow the real aspect ratio.

## Analyzing a Template

### Layer 1 (CLI)

```bash
# List all layouts
uv run python3 scripts/pptx_builder.py analyze_template my-template.pptx

# Show specific layout details
uv run python3 scripts/pptx_builder.py analyze_template my-template.pptx --layout "Content"
```

### Layer 2 (MCP)

The agent calls `analyze_template` automatically during the design phase. You can also ask directly:

> "Analyze the template and show me the available layouts"

### Layer 3 (Remote)

Templates are stored in S3 and registered in DynamoDB. The agent calls `list_templates` to see available templates, then `analyze_template` with the selected template ID.

---

## Registering a Template

### Layer 2 (Local MCP)

Place your .pptx file anywhere accessible and specify the path when initializing:

```json
{
  "tool": "init_deck_workspace",
  "arguments": {
    "name": "My Deck"
  }
}
```

Or simply tell the agent: "Use my-template.pptx for this presentation."

Place templates in `sdpm/templates/` to have them appear in `list_templates` automatically.

Included sample templates:

```
sdpm/templates/
├── sample_template_dark.pptx
└── sample_template_light.pptx
```

#### User-local templates

Custom templates can also be placed outside the package, so they survive a
`pip install --upgrade` or a re-clone of the repository. Kiro CLI / `pptx_builder.py`
searches the following locations in order and merges the results in
`list_templates`:

1. Directories listed in `$SDPM_TEMPLATES_DIR` (platform path separator: `:` on Unix, `;` on Windows — same semantics as `PATH`)
2. `<user-config>/templates/` — see **User-local directory layout** below
3. `sdpm/templates/` (package-bundled)

A user-local template shadows a bundled one with the same file name, which
makes it easy to override sample templates without editing the repository.

#### User-local directory layout

The user-local base directory is platform-aware:

| Platform | Location |
|----------|----------|
| macOS / Linux | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sdpm/` (default: `~/.config/sdpm/`) |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%/sdpm/` (default: `C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Roaming\sdpm\`) |

Layout:

```
<user-config>/sdpm/
├── templates/          # User-local .pptx templates
├── styles/             # User-local style HTMLs (see "Custom Styles" below)
├── assets/             # User-local asset sources (see "Custom Assets" below)
│   └── my-company/
│       ├── manifest.json
│       └── logo.svg
└── config.json         # Per-user config overrides (output_dir, extra_sources, …)
```

None of these paths exist by default — create only what you need
(`mkdir -p ~/.config/sdpm/styles` etc.).

### Layer 3 (Remote MCP)

Upload the template to S3 and register it in DynamoDB:

```bash
uv run python scripts/upload_template.py \
  --file my-template.pptx \
  --name "Corporate 2026" \
  --bucket <ResourceBucketName> \
  --table <TableName>
```

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|:--------:|-------------|
| `--file` | ✅ | Path to the .pptx template file |
| `--name` | ✅ | Display name for the template |
| `--bucket` | ✅ | S3 bucket name (CDK output `ResourceBucketName`) |
| `--table` | ✅ | Amazon DynamoDB table name (CDK output `TableName`) |

The script handles S3 upload, template analysis, and Amazon DynamoDB metadata registration automatically.

In the cloud Web UI, each user can add a private note to builtin and user templates from the Templates page. The agent considers these notes—including intended use cases, preferences, and default-use requests—when proposing or selecting a template.

## Custom Styles

A style is one HTML file that serves as rulebook, reference and gallery sample at once: its
`:root` tokens (colours, `--fs-*` font sizes, geometry) are machine-read by `apply_style` and
the build-time lint, and its slides are a short deck built in the style, about the style: its rules, how titles and
chapters are shaped, and one slide per recurring pattern (comparison, process, table, chart…),
each commented with the regions and components it is built from. What the gallery shows is
what a deck in that style looks like. Composers read the whole file
as `specs/art-direction.html`, and the orchestrator reads its Message & Outline part before
writing the outline, so a style shapes the deck's structure, not only its look. The skeleton
and token contract are defined in the `style` workflow (returned by `start_style()`).

### Bundled styles

Bundled styles come in two tiers. The **orthodox** tier is for when you do not want to
think about looks: any subject, any audience, light or dark. The **concept** tier is
chosen by look — each style commits to one visual idea and states how far it may be
pushed. Purpose-specific structure (how a lesson or a workshop deck is organised) belongs
to the outline, not the style, so any concept style can carry any kind of deck.

**Orthodox — pick one of these when in doubt**

| Style | Built for | Look |
|---|---|---|
| `report` | Documents read alone; numbers, tables and findings first | White, serif findings, one deep-green accent, tables and small multiples, greyscale-safe |
| `briefing` | Decks spoken to a room, re-read afterwards | Dark, one teal accent, noun-phrase titles with a topic sentence, header bands and rules instead of cards |
| `aws-dark` / `aws-light` | Decks about AWS services, architectures and cost — talks/demos (dark) or documents/print (light) | Squid Ink or white ground, official service-category colours for identification, official icons, one Smile Orange emphasis |

**Concept — choose by look**

| Style | Idea | Look |
|---|---|---|
| `neo-brutalist` | Blunt hierarchy over polish; "zero apology" | Cream ground, 6px black borders, hard 12px offset shadows, flat primary fills, uppercase labels, square corners |
| `typographic` | Type is the image; one beat per slide | White, display type at 384px that bleeds off the left edge, focus stacks in black and light grey, one red word or number at most, no shapes or rules at all |
| `signal` | Warning-sign vocabulary; one thing is highlighted | Near-black, one safety-yellow panel per slide, upright ultra-bold headlines, huge numerals, monospaced metadata, one hazard stripe |
| `racing` | Momentum; every slide hands off to the next | Near-black, italic condensed headlines, blue-violet-red top stripe, thin white speed lines, one red element |
| `bento` | One fact per tile; modular product-story rhythm | Soft grey ground, white rounded tiles (20px) on a 24px grid, exactly one dark tile and at most one blue accent tile per slide, faint shadow |
| `newspaper` | Broadsheet; the deck is meant to be read | Aged paper, near-black serif headlines, 3px masthead rule and 1px hairlines, 2–3 justified columns, drop cap, one red figure or rule |
| `swiss-poster` | One red geometric shape anchors the page | White, black type at poster sizes that never bleeds, exactly one red circle / bar / band / square (may bleed), 1–2 grid lines, a vertical label |
| `duotone` | One hard edge, two fields: claim on one, evidence on the other | Near-black and vivid orange, 50/50 or 33/67 split (vertical or horizontal); near-black type on orange, white and orange type on near-black, grey only for meta; shape bar charts with one white bar |
| `prism-dark` | The gradient is a pointer: it marks the one thing the title is talking about, everything else is flat | Near-black ground, one violet-to-pink gradient used as gradient text on the key figure, a 4px outline + one filled pill on the chosen card, or one gradient bar; a 40px gradient bar down the left edge is the only constant. No gradient panels, no blur or glow |
| `prism-light` | Same rule set as `prism-dark` for lit rooms and print | White ground, near-black type, flat white cards with 1px borders, the same violet-to-pink gradient in the same pointer roles |
| `aws-console` | The deck is an AWS Management Console screen; every piece of chrome carries deck information | Two dark header bands (aws wordmark, search box showing the deck title and slide index, notification badge = open actions, date and presenter where region and account sit; a favourites row of numbered section chips with the current section lit) over a white toolbar; page title with an Info link and an outline + orange button pair; white 2px-bordered containers with drag handle, Info, kebab and resize handle; blue links and blue metrics; three fixed status colours; dense 56px rows, no prose |

### User-local styles

Use the `style` workflow (agent-driven) to generate a new style HTML.
The workflow writes to `<user-config>/styles/{name}.html` — i.e.
`~/.config/sdpm/styles/` on macOS/Linux or `%APPDATA%/sdpm/styles/` on Windows.

You can also copy an existing style manually:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/sdpm/styles
cp sdpm/references/examples/styles/report.html \
   ~/.config/sdpm/styles/my-style.html
```

Search order (first match wins on same file name):

1. Directories listed in `$SDPM_STYLES_DIR` (platform path separator, like `PATH`)
2. `<user-config>/styles/`
3. `sdpm/references/examples/styles/` (package-bundled samples)

The styles gallery (opened by `list_styles` or the CLI `examples styles` command)
scans all three locations and displays them in a single list. User-local styles
shadow bundled ones of the same name so you can override samples without
touching the repository.

### Built-in Asset Sources

spec-driven-presentation-maker includes download scripts for two icon sets:

```bash
# AWS Architecture Icons
uv run python3 scripts/download_aws_icons.py

# Material Symbols (Google)
uv run python3 scripts/download_material_icons.py
```

Icons are stored in `sdpm/assets/` with a `manifest.json` per source:

```
sdpm/assets/
├── config.json          # Optional: user settings (gitignored, see config.example.json)
├── config.example.json  # Example config (git-managed)
├── aws/
│   ├── manifest.json    # {"icons": [{"name": "Lambda", "file": "Lambda.svg", "tags": [...]}]}
│   └── *.svg
└── material/
    ├── manifest.json
    └── *.svg
```

### Referencing Assets in Slides

```json
{
  "type": "image",
  "src": "assets:aws/Lambda",
  "x": 100, "y": 200, "width": 64, "height": 64
}
```

Reference formats:
- `assets:{source}/{name}` — From a specific source (e.g., `assets:aws/Lambda`)
- `icons:{name}` — Search all sources (backward compatible)

### Adding Custom Asset Sources

There are two ways to add a custom asset source (e.g. your company logos):

#### Option A — Drop-in under `<user-config>/assets/` (auto-discovered)

Place the source directory under the user-local assets path. It is automatically
scanned at runtime — no config changes required:

```
~/.config/sdpm/assets/my-company/     # (Windows: %APPDATA%/sdpm/assets/my-company/)
├── manifest.json
└── logo.svg
```

`manifest.json` follows the built-in format:

```json
{
  "source": "my-company",
  "icons": [
    {"name": "my-logo", "file": "logo.svg", "tags": ["brand", "logo"], "type": "service"}
  ]
}
```

Reference in `slides.json`:

```json
{ "type": "image", "src": "assets:my-company/logo", "x": 100, "y": 200, "width": 64, "height": 64 }
```

#### Option B — Explicit registration via `config.json`

Use this when the files live anywhere on disk (e.g. a shared network drive),
or when you want to point at an existing directory without moving it:

```json
{
  "extra_sources": [
    {
      "source": "mybrand",
      "manifest": "/path/to/my-icons/manifest.json",
      "files_dir": "/path/to/my-icons/"
    }
  ]
}
```

Save as `<user-config>/config.json` (see **User config** below).

### Priority order

When an asset name appears in multiple sources, the earlier source wins:

1. `extra_sources` from `config.json` — explicit override
2. `<user-config>/assets/` — auto-discovered user-local sources
3. `sdpm/assets/` — built-in sources (aws, material)
4. Legacy `icons/` directory (only if present)

This lets `extra_sources` override user-local sources, which in turn override
bundled ones. Registering a built-in name in `extra_sources` is an intentional
way to replace a bundled icon with your own.

---

## User config

Per-user configuration lives in `<user-config>/config.json` (that is,
`~/.config/sdpm/config.json` on macOS/Linux or `%APPDATA%/sdpm/config.json`
on Windows). The file is optional; missing keys fall back to defaults.

Full schema with defaults:

```json
{
  "output_dir": "~/Documents/SDPM-Presentations",
  "extra_sources": []
}
```

- `output_dir` — Base directory where generated PPTX files are written.
  Supports `~` expansion. Can also be overridden per-run via
  `$SDPM_OUTPUT_DIR`.
- `extra_sources` — Additional asset manifests (see **Option B** above).

The previously-shipped `sdpm/assets/config.json` is no longer read — it was
lost on `pip install --upgrade` and is replaced entirely by the user-local
path above.

---

### Uploading Assets to S3 (Layer 3)

```bash
uv run python scripts/upload_assets.py \
  --dir ./my-icons/ \
  --bucket <ResourceBucketName> \
  --category icons
```
