## Vibe Workflow

Vibe mode converts source material into slides with zero user confirmation.
Execute all steps sequentially without waiting for user input.

### Step 1: Read source material

Read all material the user provided (URLs via `web_fetch`, uploaded files via `read_uploaded_file`, or inline text).
For long documents, paginate to read the full content — do not stop at the first page.

### Step 2: Initialize

Call `init_presentation(name)` to create the working directory.
If there are uploaded files that the composer will need to reference or process, import them now with `import_attachment`.

### Step 3: Write specs/brief.md

Write the brief from the source material in natural prose.
The composer's only source of information is specs/ files and imported attachments.
For attached files, write pointers and summaries (not full transcription) so the composer can look up originals via line numbers.
For inline text and web content, include all data points, numbers, quotes, facts, and references.

### Step 4: Write specs/outline.md

Derive a logical slide structure from the brief. Each line = 1 slide = 1 message.

```
- [slug] What it changes in the audience and how
```

Rules:
- Aim for 5–15 slides unless the material demands more
- Use shared slug prefixes for slides that build on the same visual base
- Each slide has exactly one message
- When a slide uses data from an imported file, add evidence sub-items with file references

### Step 5: Art direction

1. Call `list_styles()` to see available styles
2. Choose the style that best fits the brief's purpose, audience, and tone
3. Call `apply_style(deck_id, style)` to set art direction
4. If the user specified a style or tone, honor that instead of inferring
5. Read `specs/art-direction.html` and extract `:root` CSS variables, then update `deck.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "template": "{template}.pptx",
     "fonts": {"fullwidth": "{fullwidth font}", "halfwidth": "{halfwidth font}"},
     "defaultTextColor": "{--color-text value}"
   }
   ```

### Step 6: Compose

Call `compose_slides(deck_id=..., slide_groups=[...])` immediately.
