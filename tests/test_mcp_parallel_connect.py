"""MCP servers must connect concurrently, and MCP_DEFS' required flag must mean something.

Background: Strands connects MCP servers serially. `ToolRegistry.process_tools()`
iterates the tools list and blocks on `await provider.load_tools()` for each
ToolProvider in turn, so three servers — one on AgentCore plus two AWS ones pinned
to us-east-1 — put their handshakes on the critical path one after another. A
profile of `create_agent()` measured roughly 2.6s going to the two AWS servers
alone.

`load_tools()` is the public ToolProvider entry point and caches its result, so
calling it up front means Strands' own call is a cache hit. Doing that in a thread
pool collapses the handshakes into the slowest one.

It also makes the `required` flag in `MCP_DEFS` do what it always claimed. The flag
was only guarding client *construction*, which is lazy and cannot fail; a failure
to reach an optional server surfaced later inside Strands as a hard ValueError
(MCPClient defaults to `continue_on_error=False`).
